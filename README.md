# Angery Pigs

Adds piglins to pre1.9 but not in the way you'd expect.

## Features
- Pigs immediately aggro and attack players not wearing gold armour
- Pigs can be right clicked or thrown with gold ingots to initiate a barter
- Pigs trade back useful items like pearls, string, arrows, snowballs, fire res potions 
- Pigs and cows will have gang wars
- 10% of Pigs will spawn with gold armour
- Pigs will equip armor when thrown to them
- Baby pigs will take your gold but won't give back anything in return
- New sound effects have been added for some pig actions
- Pigs will attempt to hurt you with the items they throw at you. If you get hit, they do half a heart of damage
